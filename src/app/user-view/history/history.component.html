      <h1>Team values</h1>
      At Text we want to publish books that make a difference to people’s lives.
      We believe that reading should be a marvellous experience, that every book you read should somehow change your life if only by a fraction.
      We love the phrase ‘lost in a book’—that’s where we want our readers to be. You can’t get lost in a newspaper or a magazine or even a movie.
      But people get lost in books every day—on the tram, on the beach, in bed.
      Reading is what keeps the imagination supple and challenges preconceptions and prejudices.
      You read at your own speed, and the world you enter courtesy of the writer is yours and yours only, even if the person next to you on the bus is reading exactly the same book.
      We publish a very broad range of fiction and non-fiction, international and local, books for adults and young adults.
      We are capable of falling in love with any book, and many of our authors have led us into fascinating territory we would never otherwise have discovered.

    <h1>About a team</h1>
    This Canadian agency presents its founding team with refreshing comedic flair. While many agency leaders choose to represent themselves with stoic business portraits, the three leaders of Zulu Alpha Kilo opted for playful photos and cheeky bios.

    Here's an excerpt from the bio of Marcus Alpha -- the agency's "Ultra Chief Creative Director Officer":

    Marcus has a reputation for pushing his creative teams further than any other creative director. He makes them work late nights, weekends and through holidays in pursuit of that one truly breakthrough creative idea. And when they’ve finally cracked it after weeks of grueling and thankless work, Marcus will triumphantly stand in front of the client and present it as an idea he had in the shower that morning instead.

    Why this works: Zulu Alpha Kilo leverages humor with its portraits and text content to draw potential clients in search of a partner on the quirky side.
